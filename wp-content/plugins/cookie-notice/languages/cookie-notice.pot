Whenever a user of your website submits personal information, for example an email, you should record and store their consent, specify what purposes or preferences it relates to, and keep a proof of their consent. With Cookie Compliance, you can easily implement Privacy Consent to your website through built-in support for WordPress or WooCommerce forms and popular form or newsletter plugins."
